# Database Overview

For this assessment, you will use Hue to examine the fun database tables and produce a database overview document similar to the one created for the default database in the demonstration video, "Exploring Structured Data Using Hue." 

**Your work serves two common real-world purposes:** 
- As you produce the overview document, you begin to explore the data in a database that you can subsequently use for analysis.
-   The document you create can help others quickly gain an overview of the data available in the database, and it can also help you whenever you return to this database after some time away.
