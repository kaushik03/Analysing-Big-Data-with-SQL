# Modern Big Data Analysis using SQL.
----------
This specialiation is offered by `Cloudera`. Which focuses on query for distributed SQL engines like **Apache Hive** and **Apache Imapala**
And Storages include Hadoop storage (HDFS) and S3 cloud storage.

There are 3 courses in this specialisation which walks through 
- **Foundations of Big Data Analysis using SQL.**
    - This throws light on  using SQL for big data, starting with an overview of data, database systems, and the common querying language (SQL). 
    - The characteristics of big data and SQL tools for working on big data platforms
    - By learning in this I'll now understand
        - To distinguish operational from analytic databases, and understand how these are applied in big data;
        - To understand how database and table design provides structures for working with data;
        - To appreciate how differences in volume and variety of data affects your choice of an appropriate database system;
        - To recognize the features and benefits of SQL dialects designed to work with big data systems for storage and analysis; and 
        - To explore databases and tables in a big data platform.

- **Analysing Big Data Using SQL.**
    - An in-depth look at the SQL SELECT statement and its main clauses.
    - Both Traditional RDBMS SQL engines and Big Data Distributed Engines like Apache Hive and Imapala.
    - After Completing This
        - explore and navigate databases and tables using different tools;
        - understand the basics of SELECT statements;
        - To understand how and why to filter results;
        - To explore grouping and aggregation to answer analytic questions;
        - To work with sorting and limiting results; and 
        - To combine multiple tables in different ways.

- **Managing Big Data in Clusters and Cloud Storage.**
    -  To how to manage big datasets.
    - How to load them into clusters and cloud storage, 
    - And how to apply structure to the data so that you can run queries on it using distributed SQL engines like Apache Hive and Apache Impala. 
    - How to choose the right data types, storage systems, and file formats based on which tools you’ll use and what performance you need.
    - This demonstarted :- 
        - To use different tools to browse existing databases and tables in big data systems;
        - To use different tools to explore files in distributed big data filesystems and cloud storage;
        - To create and manage big data databases and tables using Apache Hive and Apache Impala; and
        - To describe and choose among different data types and file formats for big data systems.

## Hands on Lab (HOL)

For Hands on Lab a VM is used, which system requirements are 
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system (iPads and Android tablets will not work)
- 64-bit operating system (32-bit operating systems will not work)
- 8 GB RAM or more
- 25GB free disk space or more
- Intel VT-x or AMD-V virtualization support enabled (on Mac computers with Intel processors, this is always enabled;
on Windows and Linux computers, you might need to enable it in the BIOS)
- For Windows XP computers only: You must have an unzip utility such as 7-Zip or WinZip installed (Windows XP’s built-in unzip utility will not work)

This Virtual Machine has an OS of CentOS version 6.8. Which has pre-installed 
- Hue Interface for SQL Engines.
- HDFS .
